# Evolutionary plant breeding of Olotillo: Single Nuclueotide Variants (SNVs) calling

This reoisitory contains the scripts to perform the SNV calling for the first 95 samples of Olotillo. This pipeline was standardized by Idalia Rojas based on the pipeline used for  the paper: [Contemporary evolution of maize landraces and their wild relatives influenced by gene flow with modern maize varieties](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817664116)


## Steps and software requirements

1. Demultiplex: [GBSx](https://github.com/GenomicsCoreLeuven/GBSX). Local installation.

2. Reads mapping against reference genome: [Picard tools](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) run as a local java -jar installation. Samtools and [NextGenMap](https://cibiv.github.io/NextGenMap/) are installed on Conabio's server.

3. Variant sicovery: [GATK 4.2.1](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases). Local installation.
 
4. Genotypes merging:  [GATK 4.2.1.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases). Local installation.
